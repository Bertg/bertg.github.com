title: A start of a new blog
---

When I just started on the web, now 15 years ago, I made a site called bertnet.be.
Actually I had a school friend make it for me. That was my first step into programming,
and i haven't looked back since.


Bertnet.be was supposed to be a place where my friend could post some ideas,
upload a picture etc. If I had shared my idea I might have made something big.

Soon after I created a little tool that allowed my friend to have a "leave a comment"
section on their sites, 1 tool was powering 3 of them, embedded into their sites.
If I had shared my idea I might have made something big.

Then I made a multiple blogs, blog... If I had shared my idea I might have made something big.

Well, you get the picture.

I've always identified as someone who solves others problems. I never have the idea
of solving something. I'm going to stop that.

I'm going to use this blog to post some of my ideas, solutions and just about anything
I please. The target is modest. 1 post per month. Let's see how well I do.
